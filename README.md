Key Insights
Overall Positive Sentiment
The majority of employees exhibit neutral to positive sentiment in their communication.    No strongly negative trends were observed across the dataset.
Top Performers Identified
Employees like Eric Bass, John Arnold, and Patti Thompson consistently demonstrate high sentiment scores, suggesting strong engagement and possibly higher morale.
No Immediate Flight Risks
Based on the criteria (≥4 negative emails within a rolling 30-day window), no employees are currently flagged as flight risks, indicating a generally stable and satisfied workforce.
Mild Variability in Tone
While all employees remained in the positive range, Don Baughman, Sally Beck, and Rhonda Denton had the lowest average sentiment, which may warrant light monitoring in future months.
Sentiment Trend is Stable
The regression model indicates a stable sentiment trend over time, with no clear upward or downward trajectory in engagement.
Recommendations
Maintain Regular Monitoring
Implement monthly sentiment scoring to track engagement and identify shifts early.
Recognize Top Communicators
Consider recognizing employees with consistently high sentiment scores to reinforce positive culture.
Engage Lower Sentiment Employees
Reach out to employees with lower (but still positive) sentiment — such as Don Baughman or Sally Beck — for feedback, support, or morale checks.
Scale the Model for Real-Time Use
This approach can be scaled using automation (e.g., Power Automate + Python pipeline) for real-time employee feedback analytics.
Add More Features for Deeper Insight
In future iterations, consider incorporating department, message volume, and tenure for more targeted analysis.# Ziyun-Han-AI-project-submission
